# The game of goose, to have some fun

The project concerns a basic implementation of the goose game. Within the code, even if in a simple way, there are some patterns: 
**singleton**, **strategy**, **factory**, **proxy** and **builder** pattern.   There are also some unit tests

**If you have suggestions on how to improve or possibly rethink some parts of the code,  
I would be happy to receive them.**

Build and run
---
The project is based on Java and Maven as a dependency manager. 

Before executing the following commands, I assume that you already have  
the following tools on your system: **git**, **java 8**, **maven**

Remember to set your maven **settings.xml** file **if you need to go through a proxy**


To use the code on this repo from command line:
* command to type to get the local source code
```
git clone https://github.com/ant-giannone/tlabs-goose-game.git
```
* move to the project folder

* **mvn clean install** to perform dependency download, project build and installation of the jar produced on your local repo
```
mvn clean install
```
* **If you just want to produce the jar but don't install it on your local repo**
```
mvn clean package
```
* **If you prefer not to perform the tests**
```
 mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
* to execute from the command line the jar produced, move to the **target folder** and type:  
```
java -jar tlabs-goose-game-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Java properties that you could modify
---

if you prefer, you can change the values of the following properties to change some game behaviors: 
* the cell where to place the bridge and the respective jump cell
* the cells on which the players can find the goose
* the victory cell

```
application.board.cell.victory=63
application.board.element.bridge.cell=6
application.board.element.bridge.jump_to_cell=12
application.board.element.goose.cell=5,9,14,18,23,27
```
